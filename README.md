## Features

* Simple and easy to implement React component for rendering interactive vector maps.
* Bring your own vector map, see how to [use your own SVG for a map](https://react-vector-maps.netlify.com/?path=/story/üìñ-documentation--using-your-own-svg-for-a-map).
* Quick and easy to style maps however you like.
* 100+ vector maps included out of the box, free from [MapSVG](http://mapsvg.com/maps/).

## Basic Usage

```
import React from 'react';
import VectorMap from '@south-paw/react-vector-maps';
import world from '@south-paw/react-vector-maps/maps/json/world.json';

const MyMap = () => (
  <VectorMap {...world} />
);

export default MyMap;
```
